<h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>
<div>
<p>This is really a simple dis to prepare and it's always a bit hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
<blockquote>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room tempature beofre you serve it. In the winter, try to serving it warm."</blockquote>
